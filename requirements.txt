Sure, no problem! Here's an example of how you can use `matplotlib` to visualize the keyword clusters without using `networkx`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter

# Assuming you have the 'results' list from the previous script
for result in results:
    question = result['question']
    phrases = result['phrases']
    cluster_labels = result['cluster_labels']

    # Count the frequency of each phrase in each cluster
    cluster_counts = []
    for i in set(cluster_labels):
        cluster_phrases = [phrase for j, phrase in enumerate(phrases) if cluster_labels[j] == i]
        cluster_counts.append(dict(Counter(cluster_phrases)))

    # Create a figure with subplots for each cluster
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(set(cluster_labels)), figsize=(16, 6))

    # Plot the top 50 phrases for each cluster
    for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
        ax.bar(list(cluster_counts[i].keys())[:50], list(cluster_counts[i].values())[:50])
        ax.set_title(f'Cluster {i}')
        ax.set_xlabel('Phrase')
        ax.set_ylabel('Count')
        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)

    fig.suptitle(f'Keyword Clusters for Question: {question}', fontsize=16)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

This script will create a figure with one subplot for each cluster, and in each subplot, it will display the top 50 phrases within that cluster, along with their frequency.

The key steps in this process are:

1. Iterate through the 'results' list, which contains the data for each question.
2. For each question, count the frequency of each phrase in each cluster using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
3. Create a figure with subplots using `plt.subplots()`.
4. In each subplot, plot the top 50 phrases for the corresponding cluster using `ax.bar()`.
5. Add labels, titles, and other formatting to make the visualization more informative.

The resulting visualization will provide a clear overview of the most frequent phrases in each cluster for the given question. You can use this information to further analyze and interpret the content of the keyword clusters.
